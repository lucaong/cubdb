defmodule CubDB.CatchUp do
  @moduledoc false

  # The `CubDB.CatchUp` module takes care of catching up a compacted Btree with
  # updates performed on the live Btree during a compaction process. The
  # catch-up process is ran in the background, does not block read/write
  # operations, and can be started multiple times until the compacted Btree is
  # in sync with the live one.
  #
  # The catch-up is performed by iterating through all updates happened after
  # the compaction (or the last catch-up) started, using the `Btree.Diff`
  # enumerable to enumerate updates between two Btrees representing two
  # snapshots of the same (live) store.
