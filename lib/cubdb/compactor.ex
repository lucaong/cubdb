defmodule CubDB.Compactor do
  @moduledoc false

  # The `CubDB.Compactor` module takes care of the compaction, to reclaim disk
  # space. It does so by loading all entries in a new store (using the fast
  # algorithm provided by `Btree.load/2`). This will cause the new store to only
  # contain the entries reachable from the current root. This is the so called
  # compaction phase.
  #
  # After compacting, `CubDB.Compactor` also needs to catch up the compacted
  # Btree with updates performed on the live Btree while the compaction was
  # running. The catch up process can be iterated multiple times until the
  # compacted Btree is in sync with the live one.
  #
  # The catch up is performed by iterating through all updates happened after
  # the compaction (or the last catch up) started, using the `Btree.Diff`
  # enumerable to enumerate updates between two Btrees representing two
  # snapshots of the same (live) store.
