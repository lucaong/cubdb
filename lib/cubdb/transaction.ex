  If `key` was not written since the point in time represented by `snapshot`,
  returns `:unchanged`. Otherwise, behaves like `fetch/2`.

  Checking if the key was written is done without fetching the whole entry, but
  instead only checking index pages. This makes `refetch/3` useful as a
  performance optimization in cases when one needs to verify if an entry changed
  with respect to a snapshot: using `refetch/3` can save some disk access if
  `CubDB` is able to determine that the key was not written since the snapshot.

  In some situations, such as when the entry is not present in the database, or
  when a compaction completed after `snapshot`, the function cannot determine if
  the entry was written or not since `snapshot`, and therefore fetches it. In
  other words, `refetch/3` is a performance optimization to save some disk reads
  when possible, but it might fetch an entry even if it technically did not
  change.

  ## Example

  The function `refetch/3` can be useful when implementing optimistic
  concurrency control. Suppose, for example, that computing the updated value of
  some entry is a slow operation. In order to avoid holding a transaction open
  for too long, one could compute the update outside of the transaction, and
  then check if the value on which the update was computed is still the same: if
  so, commit the update, otherwise perform the computation again. This kind of
  optimistic concurrency control can use `refetch/3` to avoid reading the value
  from disk when nothing has changed:

      def update_optimistically(db, key) do
        outcome = CubDB.with_snapshot(db, fn snap ->
          {:ok, value} = CubDB.Snapshot.fetch(snap, key)

          # Perform the slow calculation outside of the transaction
          new_value = some_slow_calculation(value)

          # In a transaction, check if the value changed, and update it if not
          write_if_unchanged(db, key, value, snap)
        end)

        # Depending on the outcome, return or recompute
        case outcome do
          :recompute ->
            update_optimistically(db, key)

          :ok ->
            :ok
        end
      end

      defp write_if_unchanged(db, key, value, snap) do
        CubDB.transaction(db, fn tx ->
          # Check if the value changed in the meanwhile
          case CubDB.Tx.refetch(tx, key, snap) do
            :unchanged ->
              # The entry was not written since we last read it. Commit the
