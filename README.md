`CubDB` is an embedded key-value database for the Elixir language. It is
designed for robustness, and for minimal need of resources.

Head to the [API reference](https://hexdocs.pm/cubdb/CubDB.html) for usage
details, or read the [Frequently Asked
Questions](https://hexdocs.pm/cubdb/faq.html) and the [How To
section](https://hexdocs.pm/cubdb/howto.html) for more information.


## Features

  - Both keys and values can be any Elixir (or Erlang) term.

  - Basic `get`, `put`, and `delete` operations, selection of ranges of entries
    sorted by key with `select`.

  - Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable (ACID) transactions.

  - Multi version concurrency control (MVCC) allowing concurrent read
    operations, that do not block nor are blocked by writes.

  - Unexpected shutdowns or crashes won't corrupt the database or break
    atomicity of transactions.

  - Manual or automatic compaction to reclaim disk space.

To ensure consistency, performance, and robustness to data corruption, `CubDB`
database file uses an append-only, immutable B-tree data structure. Entries are
never changed in-place, and read operations are performed on zero cost immutable
snapshots.


## Usage

Start `CubDB` by specifying a directory for its database file (if not existing,
it will be created):

```elixir
{:ok, db} = CubDB.start_link(data_dir: "my/data/directory")
```

> #### Important {: .warning}
>
> Avoid starting multiple `CubDB` processes on the same data
> directory. Only one `CubDB` process should use a specific data directory at any
> time.

`get`, `put`, and `delete` operations work as you probably expect:

```elixir
CubDB.put(db, :foo, "some value")
#=> :ok

CubDB.get(db, :foo)
#=> "some value"

CubDB.delete(db, :foo)
#=> :ok

CubDB.get(db, :foo)
#=> nil
```

Multiple operations can be performed atomically with the `transaction` function
and the `CubDB.Tx` module:

```elixir
# Swapping `:a` and `:b` atomically:
CubDB.transaction(db, fn tx ->
  a = CubDB.Tx.get(tx, :a)
  b = CubDB.Tx.get(tx, :b)

  tx = CubDB.Tx.put(tx, :a, b)
  tx = CubDB.Tx.put(tx, :b, a)

  {:commit, tx, :ok}
end)
#=> :ok
```

Alternatively, it is possible to use `put_multi`, `delete_multi`, and the other
`[...]_multi` functions, which also guarantee atomicity:

```elixir
CubDB.put_multi(db, [a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4, e: 5, f: 6, g: 7, h: 8])
#=> :ok
```

Range of entries sorted by key are retrieved using `select`:

```elixir
CubDB.select(db, min_key: :b, max_key: :e) |> Enum.to_list()
#=> [b: 2, c: 3, d: 4, e: 5]
```

The `select` function can select entries in normal or reverse order, and returns
a lazy stream, so one can use functions in the `Stream` and `Enum` modules to
map, filter, and transform the result, only fetching from the database the
relevant entries:

```elixir
# Take the sum of the last 3 even values:
CubDB.select(db, reverse: true) # select entries in reverse order
|> Stream.map(fn {_key, value} -> value end) # discard the key and keep only the value
|> Stream.filter(fn value -> is_integer(value) && Integer.is_even(value) end) # filter only even integers
|> Stream.take(3) # take the first 3 values
|> Enum.sum() # sum the values
#=> 18
```

Read-only snapshots are useful when one needs to perform several reads or
selects, ensuring isolation from concurrent writes, but without blocking them.
When nothing needs to be written, using a snapshot is preferable to using a
transaction, because it will not block writes.

Snapshots come at no cost: nothing is actually copied or written on disk or in
memory, apart from some small internal bookkeeping. After obtaining a snapshot
with `with_snapshot`, one can read from it using the functions in the
`CubDB.Snapshot` module:

```elixir
# the key of y depends on the value of x, so we ensure consistency by getting
# both entries from the same snapshot, isolating from the effects of concurrent
# writes
{x, y} = CubDB.with_snapshot(db, fn snap ->
  x = CubDB.Snapshot.get(snap, :x)
  y = CubDB.Snapshot.get(snap, x)

  {x, y}
end)
```

The functions that read multiple entries like `get_multi`, `select`, etc. are
internally using a snapshot, so they always ensure consistency and isolation
from concurrent writes, implementing multi version concurrency control (MVCC).

For more details, read the [API documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/cubdb/CubDB.html).

## Installation

`CubDB` can be installed by adding `:cubdb` to your list of dependencies in
`mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:cubdb, "~> 2.0.2"}
  ]
end
```
